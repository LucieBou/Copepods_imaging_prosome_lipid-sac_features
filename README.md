# Copepods_imaging_prosome_lipid-sac_features
**Lucie Bourreau - March, 2025**

## Presentation    

The aim of this repository is to compute copepod traits from images that are needed to calibrate the Coltrane model (https://github.com/LucieBou/Coltrane_calibration.git). 

Python scripts are listed in order of use. At the beginning of each script a brief description of its purpose is given. In addition, each function has a dockstring.

References are added as comments when necessary, especially for features computation (01_compute_prosome_lipids_features.py).
